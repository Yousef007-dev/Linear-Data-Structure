# Linear-Data-Structure
This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental linear data structures, which are essential for understanding data organization and manipulation in computer science.

📚 Data Structures Included
Array: A collection of elements identified by index or key.

Linked List: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion.

Stack: A collection that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

Queue: A collection that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
